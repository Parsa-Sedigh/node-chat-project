/* Security tip: Now a user can write malicious code into the chat box and we don't want this!!! So we can begin our server side
* and sanitize any incoming messages before we broadcast those messages out to any and all connected browsers.
* After doing this task, if a malicious user trying to send over a bit of malicious code, YES they can see their own malicious
* message in their chat log but for other people, that malicious code would be sanitized by the server(because when a user submits a
* message in his chat box, the frontend will send this message to backend and backend will sanitize the message and THEN broadcast
* it.). So the other users won't get the malicious message.
*
* Now let's assume the worst case and assume that for some reason, that server side sanitization did not work for. For innocent
* users we still want some kind of last line of defense within the client side.So we must use DOMPurify package in this file too!
* and we use this package in our displayMessageFromServer() method to sanitize incoming messages from server and also we can use
* this package in sendMessageToServer()
*
* After all of this works we know that a malicious user could modify the JS on their client side but anyways we now have security!!!
*  So now even if our server side sanitization for some reason failed, we can rest assured that our other users still have
* client side sanitization to protect them. */
